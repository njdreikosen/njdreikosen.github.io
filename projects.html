              <h2>Independent | Ongoing</h2>
              <p>
                &emsp;In order to host my own web apps, I created a local server consisting of a Raspberry Pi,
                two external HDDs, and a powered USB hub. To house the assembly, I designed and 3D printed
                a modular case that can be adapted to fit various sized HDDs and USB hubs.<br>&emsp;Currently,
                the server is running a web app that is a combination of several single page applications (SPAs),
                including a calendar, a remote file host/explorer, and a engineering equation solver (still in progress).
                For more details, the Github repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/njdreikosen/local_app_server" target="_blank">here</a>,
                and the 3D printed case STL files can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4868724" target="_blank">here</a>.

              <p>
                &emsp;To help compartmentalize functionality for an SMS-based event alert app
                (which was to be named Meeper, but due to AT&T raining on my parade, it was never finished),
                I created a Python package for listening in an email folder and scraping and processing
                incoming emails. Additionally, the EmailResponder class was included for a simple, pain-free
                way of responding to the processed emails. The package was
                <a href="https://pypi.org/project/email-listener/" target="_blank">published to PyPi</a>, where it seems at least
                a few other people have found a use for it. The Github repo can be found
                <a href="https://github.com/njdreikosen/email_listener" target="_blank">here</a>.

              <p>
                &emsp;As a part of a senior design course, I worked on a team that redesigned a Caterpillar
                utility compactor to on electric motors instead of the original diesel engine.

              <p>
                &emsp;In an introduction to robotics course, I worked on a team that created a wheeled mobile robot that
                could find a table edge and following it, while also sensing whether a cup was in front of the robot
                and flipping it. The control application was written with Python on a Raspberry Pi.

              <p>
                &emsp;As a part of a software engineering course, I worked on a team that developed a loyalty app for the
                University Book Store.  It was an integrated web application built with Vue.js which displayed the
                user’s points, the store’s social media feeds, and information about the loyalty program.

              <h2>UW - Madison</h2>
              <p>
                &emsp;As part of an introductory engineering class, we designed and manufactured a prototype
                hydraulic launcher that launched a drinking straw for use in middle school science classes.
                We worked with the STEM Education Coalition, who funded the project, and set our design specifications.

              <p>
                &emsp;As part of the Wausau InvenTeam, I helped design and manufacture a prototype semi-autonomous
                snow blower using a grant from the Lemelson-MIT InvenTeams program. The prototype was presented
                at EurekaFest 2014 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus.

              <h2>3D Printer Setup and Projects</h2>
              <p>
                &emsp;In order to create prototypes for future projects, I setup an Creality Ender 3 printer,
                which including building, calibrating, and modifying the printer. Along with this, I design
                and print many miscellanious projects, including coasters, hat hooks, and Lego display mounts.
                This involved experimenting with and optimizing a variety of settings, including the base GCode,
                in order to increase the print quality of the various features in each print.

              <h2>Text-Based Game Generator</h2>
              <p>
                &emsp;As an independent project, I created a Java program that would select a random text-based adventure from
                a parameter file, and generate that adventure, including both pre-set and randomly generated events.
                The parameter file could be easily edited so that additional scenarios could be added.
